2.2.4
-----
o Empty files are now handled gracefully and no longer infinitely loop
o Multiline fields are now enabled by default

2.2.3
-----
o Prints summary in the end of how many entities where imported.

2.2.2
-----
o Ability to skip duplicate nodes (nodes w/ duplicate input ids within the same id space).
  For this --skip-duplication-nodes as well as --skip-bad-relationships have been added.
  Number of bad entries to tolerate collectively is still controlled using --bad-tolerance
o Improved user feedback on common and import errors and user mistakes like forgetting to
  specify input files or leaving out mandatory header information etc. In some cases also
  points out a place in the manual for further information about a particular problem.
o Removes the --bad option which previously could specify the location and file name of
  the log containing bad input entries after an import. Now that log file will always be
  <into>/bad.log
o Input file names can now contain regular expressions and therefore match multiple files.
  Matching files will be correctly ordered according to any and all numbers found in their file names.
o Ability to allow/disallow multi-line fields, i.e. fields containing new-line characters.
  This to have a better default defense against missing end quotes.
  Default is to disallow multi-line fields. While being a change in behavior, this option
  will most likely result in less surprising handling of fields missing end quotes..

2.2.1
-----
o Ability to specify input encoding (using --input-encoding)
